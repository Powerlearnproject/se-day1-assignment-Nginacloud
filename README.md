Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the systematic process of applying engineering principles, methods and tools to the designing, development, testing and maintenance of quality software systems.

*Importance* 

-Enabling creation of reliable software apps and systems

-Reduces complexities by breaking down problems to smaller parts, solving one issue at a time

-Ensuring effectiveness of the software ie quality assurance

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-Emergence of the Agile software development methodologies; flexibility, collaboration and responsiveness to change

-Transition from art to an engineering discipline; it evolved from being only learnt by specified people to using established processes to a more scientific and systematic approach to software development.

-Development of new methodologies, techniques and tools; like IDEs and Testing Frameworks

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

-Requirements; involves analyzing, validating and managing systems to understand user/stakeholder requirements.

-Design; creating reliable, scalable and maintainable base for software systems.

-Implementation; writing code and building the software according to the required specifications/design.

-Testing; creating the text documentation to ensure comprehensiveness and using to conduct tests ensuring the software meet the requirements.

-Deployment; releasing the final product to bring it to effective action.

-Maintenance; continous support process the ensures the system is working correctly and adjusted to meet the growing needs of the user.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

-Waterfall methodology is a traditional approach where each phase of the project is copleted in sequence before moving on to the next. its rigid as there is no room for unexpected changes hence suitable for projects with clear and stable goals. Wheras Agile methodology is a flexible approach that allows for continous/improved room to pivot making it suitable for projects with evolving requirements.

-Both methodologies are aimed at delivering project goals based on end user's preffered requirements, despite one being less flexible they both deliver.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

-Software Developer; writes code, implement and maintaines computer programs and applications.

-Quality Assurance Engineer; designs and executes test plans to identify and maintain a set of required standards in the developed software.

-Project Manager; oversees the organization, planning and execution of projects to ensure successful processes and their delivery.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

-IDEs are software suites that for writing, editing, debugging and testing code. It helps boost developer productivity by reducing set up time as they cover the four aspects. Example is the Visual Code Studio

-VCS are software tools for tracking and recording changes plus coordinating people for team projects. Provides a wider platform for access and tracking modifications made to the code. Examples include Git

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-Changing requirements during the development process which could bring about scope creep and project delays as sometimes it'd be difficult to deal with.

-Misinterpreted requirements and inadequate communication may give rise to porblems in terms of the deliverable project, product fails to give the intended result of the end user.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

-Unit testing - a technique where individual components/modules of a software application are tested individually to ensure they work properly, early in the development phase.

-Intergration testing - this requires verifying interactions and data exchange between different components. Done after unit and before system testing.

-System testing - this phase evaluates overall functionality and perfomance of the entire integrated software.

-Acceptance testing - testing and validating the fully integrated software solution against the user requirements and specifications and confirm the systems operations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is the crafting of questions and or statements that are clear, concise and complete to get the best possible response from AI models.
Prompt engineering help craft and improve the right instruction to AI given that the models are trained on big datasets hence the understanding rate is low and misinterpretation maybe high.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

-A vague Prompt; Describe The National Archives.

-An Improved Prompt; Narrate the history of the Kenyan National Archives.

The improved prompt is more effective because its specific, stating the excact archives we want info on, its also clear in that the response will mostly be in story form of the historical significance rather that physical description.
